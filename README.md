# Data Analysis and Cleaning with Python

## Overview
This classroom exercise involves analyzing and cleaning a dataset originally provided in Excel format and later converted to CSV.
The primary goal is to explore the dataset, identify irregularities or missing values,
and apply necessary corrections to prepare it for further analysis.

## Dataset
- Source: Excel file provided by the instructor  
- Format used: Converted to CSV (data.csv)  
- Contents: Includes various data attributes relevant to the assignment  

## Features Implemented
- Read and load CSV data using Python libraries
- Check for missing or invalid entries
- Apply data cleaning techniques such as:
  - Filling or dropping missing values
  - Correcting malformed data
  - Normalizing inconsistent formats
- Generate summary statistics for cleaned data

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy  
- (Add JalaliDatetime from khayyam)
